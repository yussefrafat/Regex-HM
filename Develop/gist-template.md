## Regex HM

As a Full Stack Web Dev student, I developed a tutorial explaining a specifics of regex so that we can understand the search pattern the regex defines

## Summary

This is a tutorial breakdown on how Regex is used to match a Hex Value in a body of text. /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/ is the syntax that I will be using.

Hex Code is a way to identify color. It is always in a 6-digit alphanumeric sequence.

The regex string I am using will return a # Number sign character followed by either a 6 or 3 character length code with only lowercase letters a,b,c,d,e,or f or numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9.
